# Flask-Rest_API-Person_Tracker
This is a sipmle REST API  that I built using Flask for python and focusing on get, post, delete and update methods.
The program acts as a simple database that can store information of an input. In this simple example it stores the name, age and country of an input and also assigns them and ID number so their information can be accessed and manipulated.
